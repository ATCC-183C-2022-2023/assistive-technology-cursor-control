# gesture_recognition

This project aims to recognize human hand gestures by using keypoints generated by [mediapipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) on datasets such as [Egogesture](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/iva/yfzhang/datasets/egogesture.html) and [IPN](https://gibranbenitez.github.io/IPN_Hand/)

## Accuracies achieved so far with various algorithms

| Algorithm     | Accuracy      |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| SVM           | 86.25%        |
| Random Forest | 92.36%        |
| MLP           | 88.54%        |
| LSTM          | 82.88%        |

### mediapipe.mat
This file contains the keypoints generated by [mediapipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) on a subset of the [EgoGesture](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/iva/yfzhang/datasets/egogesture.html) dataset as a mat and is used in the random forest and SVM approaches

### data and data_rotated
This folder has the keypoints generated by [mediapipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) on the entirety(?) of the [EgoGesture](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/iva/yfzhang/datasets/egogesture.html) dataset in JSON format used in the MLP and LSTM neural networks

### keypoint_classifier.py
This script uses a GRU network to classify gestures in real time

### OpenPose
OpenPose could serve as an alternative to MediaPipe, but it does not seem to provide any significant benefits
