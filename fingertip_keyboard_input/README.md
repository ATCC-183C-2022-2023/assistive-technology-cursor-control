# Fingertip Keyboard Input
A computer application that allows keyboard input by drawing letters in the air, captured by a web camera.

## How to Run
From this directory, install packages using `pip install -r ../requirements.txt`
Within the `fingertip_keyboard_input` directory, run `python mouse_and_keyboard_control.py`

## Modes
There are two main modes: Mouse Mode and Keyboard Mode. To switch between modes, the user can use the “fist” gesture with both hands simultaneously.

| 4      | 3          |  browser: decrease text size|
| 4      | 4          |  browser: increase text size|
| 5      | 1          |  browser: new tab|
| 5      | 2          |  browser: address bar|

## Further Work
- Top down implementation to reduce fatigue
- Multi-letter/entire word support
- User-createable custom gesture support
- More support for other special characters (currently supported: space, backspace)
- Resizeable windows
