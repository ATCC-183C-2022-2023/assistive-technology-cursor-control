## Description of Directories
The most recent work that has been updated is in the `fingertip_keyboard_input` directory, worked on in Fall 2022, Spring 2023, and Fall 2023. This directory includes work for both keyboard control and mouse control. Further instructions can be found within the directory's readme.

`fingertip_keyboard_input` directly incorporates the work of `two_handed_gestures`, which is work completed by previous members of the group on the mouse control. As such, `two_handed_gestures` was last updated Fall 2022.

`cursor_free_web_browsing` is another method of cursor free mouse control for browsers. It was last updated Fall 2022. Further instructions can be found within the directory's readme.

`simplified_cursor_control` is a browser extension to aid the use of `two_handed_gestures`, which is then used by `fingertip_keyboard_input`. It was last updated Fall 2022. Again, further instructions can be found within the directory's readme. 

`gesture_recognition`, `user_research`, and `hand_tracking` are directories simply for testing and research. They were last updated in Fall 2021 (except for some compatibilities requirements).
